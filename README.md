Please check our detailed presentation and paper poster at the [./slides](https://github.com/ZIYU-DEEP/Understanding-Bias-in-Deep-Anomaly-Detection-PyTorch/tree/main/slides) folder.

## 1. Introduction
Simply put, we discover the counter-intuitive fact that additional labeled data in anomaly detection can hurt training and bring disastrous bias â€“ *knowing more does not mean doing better*!

Theoretically, we propose the *first* rigorous PAC analysis for estimating the relative scoring bias for deep anomaly detection; empirically, we provide the *first* comprehensive experiments on how a biased training anomaly set affects the detection performance on different anomaly classes.

The takeaway message is anomaly detection practitioner must *not* blindly believe in SOTA models, and must treat additional labeled data with extra care.

In this code repository, we provide an easy



## 2. Requirements
```
numpy==1.22.2
pandas==1.3.4
torch==1.4.0
joblib==0.14.1
scikit-learn==0.22.2
torchvision==0.5.0
```

## 3. Code Structure
The high-level structure of the codebase follows the ICLR '20 paper "[Deep semi-supervised anomaly detection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkgH0TEYwH)". We thank them for the open-source work for the anomaly detection community.

- `./dataset` provides various data loaders supporting datasets like [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/), [FashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), [Driver Anomaly Detection](https://www.ei.tum.de/mmk/dad/), [Retina OCT Images](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/kermany2018), and your own customized datasets. You can check the the `main_loading.py` inside for a detailed list.
- `./network` provides several network structures to build up the model. Please see the viables options in `main_network.py`.
- `./model` contains six popular and SOTA models for anomaly detection, ranging from Deep SVDD to Autoencoding Binary Classifier. Please check our paper for the detailed model description.
- `./main` contains the main files to verify the PAC analysis or to characterize the effect of bias.
